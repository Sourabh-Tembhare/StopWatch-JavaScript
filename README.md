# ⏱️ Stopwatch Project  

A simple and responsive **Stopwatch** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project includes three main functions:  

- ▶️ **Start** – Begin the stopwatch  
- ⏸️ **Stop** – Pause the stopwatch  
- 🔄 **Reset** – Reset back to 00:00:00  

I also created a **YouTube lecture** explaining this project step by step.
